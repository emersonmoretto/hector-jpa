A JPA implementation for Apache Cassandra.

This release is only compatible with 0.8.1 forward.  Cassandra now natively supports DynamicComposites.


The hector jar in lib is required until this merge is built into the next release.

# What this plugin supports

* Direct field to column mapping

* One-To-* Ordered and Unordered Collections
* Many-To-* Ordered and Unordered Collections
* Entity cascading based on cascade behavior
* Inerhitance
* Basic Secondary indexing with inheritance


# What this plugin does not support

* OR query clauses
* IN and other query apis currently unsupported by Cassandra


# Roadmap

As cassandra matures, this plugin will as well.  Below is the roadmap for these features

* Continue working with OpenJPA to make this part of the Open JPA Core
* Convert client from Hector to CQL JDBC compliant driver
* Remove client site composite row secondary indexing and use the Distributed Lucene Index.  This depends on this issue.  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2915


# Querying

Querying requires the user to define secondary indexes on Entities.  See the UserDateRange and Sale classes in the test cases for examples.
This plugin requires build time enhancement.  This is due to the startup time analysis for inheritance in the query engine. As CQL improves, this limitation can be removed.
